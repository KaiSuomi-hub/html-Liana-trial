A test on html and css for internship.

I'll include my thoughts and ideas here in the documentation.

**7.5. The unpacking and tasking**

Went through the task and extracted materials from the provided layout.psd. Even though responsivity was hoped for there was no layout provided for mobile devices.

Bootstrap would be an obvious choice for the framework as the ready b. points and jquery would make extra points easier to score.

Going to give tailwind a go first, even if I haven't used it before, as this would be a good learning experience.
