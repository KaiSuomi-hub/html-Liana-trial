A test on html and css for internship 💻

I'll include my thoughts and ideas here in the documentation.

🎁**7.5 The unpacking and tasking**🎁

Went through the task and extracted materials from the provided layout.psd. Even though responsivity was hoped for there was no layout provided for mobile devices.

Bootstrap would be an obvious choice for the framework as the ready b. points and jquery would make extra points easier to score.

Going to give tailwind a go first, even if I haven't used it before, as this would be a good learning experience 🤓

5hrs later: Yeah, not sure how much better tailwind is than just plain flex/grid with sass 🤨
Gonna go along with it anyways.

**8.5 Learning tailwind**

Honestly, it's been fun to learn the use of tailwind.
Even though I feel often I'd like to just do a basic grid in sass and get rid of extra hassle. I think in the future I'll probably try to use tailwind with along react.

Plugging the compile script to package.json to go along with the react build will be easy, but I wonder how long it'd take for me to have the same instinctive feel to the tailwind classes that I have for basic css 🧭

**10.5 3rd day, total time spent: 14 hours**

Starting the third day on the task and I have probably spent 14 hours on it. I think actually four or five of are actual working hours and the rest is just playing with tailwind or trying to get it to work.
😅 doing the whole page with breakpoints and a hamburger menu would take me eight to ten hours total with just css and vanilla javascript 😭

**11.5 4th day, total time spent: 18 hours**

I'm sold. Tailwind, liveserver and sass allow me an insanely more intuitive and responsive development experience. My total dev time per ⏱\<section\>⏱ has been going steadily down after grogging the process.
I need to thank Liana for this experience even if don't get the internship 😋
